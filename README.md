# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in HTML, CSS and javaScript. It allows two players to take turns placing their markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all spaces are filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
